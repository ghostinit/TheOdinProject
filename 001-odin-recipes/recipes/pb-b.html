    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>PB&B! Simple right? Why would there need to be a 'recipe'?</p>
    <p>Well, let me tell you there are ways to take this simple meal to the next level!  We will be introducing flavors and texture that can frankly be a little mind blowing!</p>
    <p>Join us on this journey into the delicious possibilites of PB&B!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of Bread (preferrably whole wheat, large slice)</li>
        <li>1 medium to large Banana (for max flavor choose one that is solid yellow and starting to have slight spotting</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of Peanut Butter (my preference is all natural with no sugar)</li>
        <li>Cinnamon, Pumpkin Pie Spice or Apple Pie Spice</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of Honey (try to use raw unfiltered honey sourced locally)</li>
        <li>Liberal amount of Love</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast the bread!  Avoid using the ends.  The bread should be toasted to an even tawny brown color.</li>
        <li>On one of the slices, apply exactly 2 tbsp of peanut butter.  If excess peanut butter is used you run the risk of the peanut butter flavor stealing the show</li>
        <li>Evenly apply the honey on top of the peanut butter.  Doesn't have to be perfect</li>
        <li>Remove the peel from the banana.  Using a butter knife (safety first!) cut off the first inch of the banana and either discard or eat.  Apply a layer of banana slices that are about 3/16" (same as a standard pickle slice). Besure to cover the entire piece of bread with banana slices that are both evenly spaced but also uniform in thickness</li>
        <li>Apply a 2nd layer of banana slices in the same fashion as described above.  It helps with the final sandwich performace if the 2nd layer of bananas are offset from the first.  Try to make it so that you can't see any peanut butter through your 2 layers of banana slices</li>
        <li>Apply a <strong>GENTLE</strong> sprinkling of salt to the bananas.  I know that sounds crazy.  Most important thing here is <em><strong>DON'T OVERDO IT!</strong></em>.  The salt (believe it or not) will actually help the natural sweetness in the banana POP!</li>
        <li>Apply a fair coating of the cinnamon (or whatever your choice was).  It shouldn't be so thick as to cover everything, but should be enough to be quite visible.  It is possible to overdo it, but not as easily as the salt.</li>
        <li>Finally apply the 2nd slice of bread</li>
        <li>Let the sandwich rest for 3-5 minutes.  This allows all the flavors to comingle.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Variation</h3>
    <p>I have found it pleasant to put the honey on top of the bananas as well.  This causes the honey pool in between the banana slices and you end up getting these little honey bombs of flavor.  I encourage you to play around with configurations and find what makes your soul smile.</p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>There you have it!  A peanut butter and banana sandwich that would make Gordon Ramsey weep!</p>
